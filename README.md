# Samsao iOS test
## About
The goal of this project is to evaluate your coding skills and understand a bit of your coding style.
We created some base files so you could focus on what's most important.
Feel free to use/add frameworks, tools or anything you are comfortable with or used to, this is your time to shine!

## What to do
Your task is pretty simple, you have been given a login screen and server information (file in the project), you need to login the user into the server and display the information in a second screen you'll create.

Keep in mind that you are free to create the network layer as you wish. 
Feel free to follow your asumption in any part you think wasn't clear enough.

Time to be creative!

### Backend
Every backend information is available [here](http://api.samsaodev.com/docs/). Keep in mind that you should handle possible response timeouts or errors.

### UI
The app needs to display the profile image, the name signature, the username and password. Feel free to design the views as you wish, but if you have extra time, please know that we love beautiful iOS design :)
